# SSHelper 

The `SSHelper` package provides a r interface to retrieve catalog information from the Smith College library catalog (https://libtools.smith.edu/bento/results.php?) website and allows users to select specific source and view its cover.

## Browsing Sources

Given a title and source type via a user input the `SSHelper()` 
web scrapes the catalog and converts the URL into  
a JSON object with metadata about that catalog.
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
book_lists <- library_search("1984","books") 
```


The most useful:to browse the covers of sources use the draw_image function and press enter to view next images.
